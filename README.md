# Void Idyllic

This repository holds source files for the game [Void Idyllic](https://tjm35.itch.io/void-idyllic), submitted to GitHub GameOff 2020.

This repository does *not* contain all files required to build the game; paid assets have been omitted, along with some files too large for the version control system. Specifically, to build the game you will need to own and import:

- [Playmaker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/playmaker-368): This package will need to be locally modified to add assembly definition files (or assembly definition files need to be removed everywhere).
- [UI - Builder](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/ui-builder-29757): A number of simple images and icons from this package are used.

Sound effects and music have been omitted due to file sizes and license concerns.

Planet height cubemaps, ProCore's QuickBrush (no longer available) and [MeshCombineStudio 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/mesh-combine-studio-2-101956) have also been omitted from the repository but should not be required to build the game.
